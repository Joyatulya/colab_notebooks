# Colab Notebooks

Above are few of the different projects that I have worked. These include multilabel CXR classification tasks using tensorflow, pytorch, weights and biases,
pytorch lightning amongst others.

These were a way for me to understand the inner workings of different libraries and deep learning methodologies. Pardon if they aren't neat.

Also, I have tried to understand the semi supervised learning by coding up the SimCLR and other semi supervised training algorithms
